I am a **third-year mechanical engineering Ph.D. candidate** as a member of the [Microsystems and MechanoBiology](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/bex/pages/welcome/){:target="_blank"} (MMBL) and the [Integrated Design Innovation Group](https://www.cmu.edu/me/idig/index.html){:target="_blank"} (iDiG) at **Carnegie Mellon University** located in Pittsburgh, PA. I am advised by Professor Rebecca E. Taylor and Professor Jonathan Cagan. I am a Department of Defense (DoD) [National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate](https://www.ndseg.org/){:target="_blank"} Fellow (FY 2024). Before embarking on a Ph.D., I spent a few years in industry as a mechanical engineer at [PDSVISION US](https://pdsvision.com/){:target="_blank"}. I recieved my Bachelors of Science and Engineering (B.S.E) in Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering from Case Western Reserve University in 2019 where I worked as a research assistant in the [Computational Fire Dynamics laboratory](https://engineering.case.edu/research/labs/computational-fire-dynamics){:target="_blank"}.

## Research Interests

I am currently researching computational design methodologies for novel nanostructures. I am particularly interested in DNA origami, a self-assembly based additive nanomanufacturing methodology with sub-nanometer precision. I am currently using **Python and JAX** to develop my research ideas, and my code is (probably) open-sourced on my [GitHub](https://github.com/ajvetturini){:target="_blank"} page. I also experimentally realize my nanostructures, and am familiar with standard experimental procedures for DNA origami (i.e., pipetteing, AFM, gel eletrophoresis, etc.).

## Come meet me!

| **Sep. 2024** | I will be giving a talk at the DNA30 conference |
| **Aug. 2024** | I will be giving a talk at the ASME International Design Engineering Technical Conference (IDETC) |


## Professional Background

Before starting my Ph.D., I spent a few years in industry as a mechanical engineer at PDSVISION US. Here, I focused on FEA and CFD simulations to support various client needs. To accomplish the modelling and simulations, I used **Creo Parametric, Creo Simulate, ANSYS Mechanical, ANSYS Fluent, and Simerics MP**+. I am also intimate with product lifecycle management (PLM) systems and have **implemented and customized Windchill** based on client requirements.

Outside of research, I am a Cleveland sports fan and am also interested in sports analytics in general. I enjoy hiking, camping, and have a pair of huskies which keep me busy. I am also a member of the Graduate Student Outreach Committee where we focus on giving back to the local Pittsburgh community.
