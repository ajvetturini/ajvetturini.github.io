date: 2025-02-20
excerpt: "This code is an implementation of Cahn-Hilliard and Allen-Cahn using JAX for grid-based phase field model simulations. The free energy functionals implemented in this package are related to self-assembly principles (see [GitHub here](https://github.com/ajvetturini/phase-field-models) for more direct references)."
