	abstract = {There are no existing experimental studies of ﬂame spread rate trends for ultra-thin solid samples. Previous theory has predicted that for concurrent ﬂame in kinetic regime, the ﬂame spread rate decreases as the sample thickness decreases and there is a critical thickness below which burning is not possible. To test this hypothesis, a series of microgravity experiments of concurrent-ﬂow ﬂame spread over samples of ultra-low area densities are conducted using NASA Glenn Research Center’s Zero Gravity Research Facility (the 5.18 s drop tower). The tested samples are cellulosebased materials of various area densities, ranging from 0.2 mg/cm2 to 13 mg/cm2, as low as one order of magnitude less than those ever tested before. Each sample is 30 cm long by 5 cm wide and is burned in a low-speed concurrent air ﬂow (5 to 30 cm/s). The results show that the concurrent ﬂame spread rate is proportional to the ﬂow velocity relative to the ﬂame and is inversely proportional to the sample area density. A theoretical formulation, provided in this work, suggests that the ﬂame length has a linear relationship with the relative ﬂow speed and has no direct dependency on the sample area density. The experimental data supports this conclusion. From the images recorded in the experiments, a unique ﬂame base tubular structure directed upstream away from the burnout zone is observed for thin samples. This structure is suspected to be due to ﬂame stretching and localized blowoﬀ caused by the oxidative pyrolysis Stefan ﬂows at the sample burnout. This can be an indication that the chemical time becomes comparable to the ﬂow time of the Stefan ﬂow and the tested samples are approaching the kinetically-limited thickness. For the thinnest tested sample (0.2 mg/cm2), ﬂames with concurrent and opposed dual natures are observed when the air ﬂow rate is low ({\textless} 20 cm/s). At the lowest tested ﬂow rate (5 cm/s), the ﬂame spread rate exceeds the air ﬂow rate and the ﬂame transits to an opposed ﬂame in the concurrent ﬂow. The dual nature and ﬂame transition are presented and discussed. This study provides detailed examination through high-resolution images of the transition between the concurrent to opposed ﬂame spread modes.},
